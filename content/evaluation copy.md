Every student is expected to produce a personal critical analysis on a topic of their choice, a ‘case study‘ related to an issue of ‘digital democracy’.

On the ‘backend’, it should be a ‘classical research’ or investigation, with a research question, potential hypotheses, good references and hopefully some results in the end.

But on the ‘frontend’, students have to produce something ‘digital’ (not a simple paper in .pdf). The format is up to you—feel free to be creative (website, podcast, video, interactive presentation, newsletter, Twitter thread, application…). No size requirements, because it varies a lot depending on the chosen format, but it should reflect the theoretical 150 hours of work required to validate a 5-credits seminar.
