Hi! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm [Jonathan](https://twitter.com/jonapiron), a young creative entrepreneur trying to juggle between tech, medias and politics. 

I built this website for my students at [UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be), to share a bunch of interesting resources 

and serve as a starting point for our collective reflections around

characteristics

The goal of this seminar is to explore the opportunities of digital technologies for democracy, but also the risks they bring.
