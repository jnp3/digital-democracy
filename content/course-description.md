# Content

This seminar tackles the issues raised by **digital technologies** for **political institutions**, **politics** and **policies**, and more broadly for the **evolution** of what we call **“democracy“**. It also addresses the **interaction between all things political and the digitalization of society**.

Themes of discussion include, but are not limited to: **social media politics**, **algorithms and filter bubbles**, **digital divide**, **civic tech and online participation tools**, **blockchain and other governance technologies**, **Internet privacy and data collection**, **online tools for political education**…


## Learning outcomes

At the end of this seminar, the students will be able to **identify the issues raised by digital technologies on democracy**, to **develop a critical analysis on a case study related to a challenge for democracy at the digital era**, and to **communicate this analysis in writing, orally, and via digital tools**.


# Teaching methods

This seminar is conceived to be **interactive and participative**, and relies on the idea of **learning by doing**. 
Students will then be encouraged to **speak instead of only listen**, to **write instead of only read**, to **create instead of only attend**. 
They will have to **work on their own projects** and **share their findings and reflections during collective sessions**—which will establish important concepts for studying and shaping democracy in the digital age.


## Evaluation methods

The evaluation is **continuous and ends before the exams’ session**. The final grade (from 0 to 20 points) is composed of **two parts**: 

1. the **contribution to the course dynamics** (including active and regular participation in class and the preparation of the seminar’s sessions)—**30 %** of the final grade;
2. the **production of a personal critical analysis** on a case study related to a challenge for democracy at the digital age—**70 %** of the final grade.


### Contribution to the course dynamics

For each session, students are expected to share on Teams at least **3 resources** (article, scientific paper, podcast, interview, documentary, YouTube video, company's website...) related to the session's topic, to **contribute to a collaborative research** on the subject at hand (deadline: the day before at 23:59).

In class, they will contribute to the **writing of a collective ‘one-pager‘**, a note summarizing the ‘state of the question‘ at stake. This **‘executive summary‘** is intended to be short and then not exhaustive, but it should be the group's take on **explaining the main ideas, concepts, issues, challenges**... that gravitates around the session's theme. 

A student or group of students will be designated to **take the lead and coordinate** the creation of each executive summary: collecting contributions, deciding on the orientation of the paper, sorting the references... 

This content will then be **uploaded on the seminar's website**: [seminarofdigitaldemocracy.net](https://seminarofdigitaldemocracy.net).


### Individual case study

Every student is expected to **produce a personal critical analysis on a topic of their choice**, a ‘case study‘ related to an issue of ‘digital democracy’.

On the ‘backend’, it should be a ‘classical research’ or **investigation**, with a research question, potential hypotheses, good references and hopefully some results in the end. 

But on the ‘frontend’, students have to produce something ‘digital’ (not a simple paper in .pdf). The **format** is up to you—feel free to be creative (website, podcast, video, interactive presentation, newsletter, Twitter thread, application...). No size requirements, because it varies a lot depending on the chosen format, but it should reflect the theoretical 150 hours of work required to validate a 5-credits seminar. 

This production must be **sent on Teams before the first day of the exams session** (in 2022-2023: 8 January, 23:59).
