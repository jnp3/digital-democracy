Where did the concept of privacy originally come from? How did this concept develop in the liberal democratic context and why was it established as a fundamental right? What is the relevance of this concept in the digital age? How has privacy adapted to the security requirements of the post-9/11 era? Can we still think in terms of privacy in an age where ICTs[^1] are increasingly present in our daily lives and where the boundary between private and public spaces is more and more blurred? How can we ensure privacy at a time when surveillance capitalism[^2] is consuming more and more personal data to grow and data scandals are multiplying[^3]? Can we limit the use of personal data by new technologies (algorithms, artificial intelligence, facial recognition, etc.)? Have the GAFAM[^4] become too big to regulate? What are the democratic impacts of this growing digitalisation for three decades now and what are the dangers?

This is an overview of the many questions we will try to address in this session. We will start with a brief introduction on the origin of the concept of privacy and its history up to the present day. This will serve as a basis for a collective discussion on these many (complex) issues. You will also have the opportunity to do some concrete exercises on your smartphones and computers to better understand the issues at stake, both at individual and collective level.
