## Algorithms

If we take a quick look at the news, ”algorithms” seem to be one of these new buzzwords (not so new but still...), served up in all sorts of ways, and presented as being both the cause and consequence of all our problems.

Fine. But what exactly are ”algorithms”? And why and how did they become so omnipresent in our digital lives (and thus IRL as well)? And, maybe more interestingly, what role do they play in the political and democratic aspects of our societies? Let’s dive in!

And first and foremost, let's get the ”what exactly are we talking about?” question out of the way.


### WTF is an algorithm?!

![algorithm.gif](/images/algorithm.gif)

Basically, an algorithm is just a set of instructions. A bunch of rules, written by an engineer, to be followed by a computer in order to execute tasks and output a specific result. Algorithms are in every search engine, social media apps, etc., and deal with the data we feed them. Algorithms can also ”learn”. And this leads to what we call ”artificial intelligence” (AI).
Examples include the sorting algorithms of our social media news feed, the recommendation algorithm on YouTube, or even the Google Search algorithm.
And those algorithms have become more and more “popular” since we realized they really shaped our always more ”technologized” society in a certain way.


### Code is law?

“[Code is law](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Code_v2.pdf)”, once said law professor and activist Lawrence Lessig. Even back in the days, he couldn’t be more right.

Those algorithms seem to pull the strings of most of our online interactions, and the big corporations behind them gradually imposed themselves as the law-makers of the Internet. And the web being the interface of just about anything that connects our everydays lives, these laws do of course not only impact the virtual world.
Since ”no one is supposed to be ignorant of the law”, everyone should understand the code lines that rule the world. Or in other words, how these algorithms work. If only we could know what's inside them.

As a starting point, I'd like to bring [this food for thought from Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/2017/01/but-where-did-the-algorithm-come-from/), questioning the (lack of) transparency in the creation of the algorithms that rule our digital world (and thus, again, our everyday lives!), and reminding us that algorithms are not really obscure computer things, they're the creations of human beings. He finishes with an interpellation for the Google, Facebook and alike:

> ”Just because it makes the stockholders happy in the short run doesn't mean it's the right choice for the people who trust you.”

Therefore, as far as governance and democratic principles are concerned, we have to ask ourselves a few questions about those sacrosanct algorithms: 

- Who controls the algorithms? 
- What happens in these black boxes? 
- What data comes in?
- How do we use the results?


### The problems with algorithms

From these questions, we can draw a few quick reflections:

- The lack of transparency in the design of the algorithms that govern our digital lives is a true democratic issue.
- Anyone building an algorithm brings their own biases in the code itself, and these algorithmic biases that can lead to even more discrmination (racism, sexism).
- Filter bubbles, resulting from the way algorithms sort information online, creates more division and lack of understanding between groups of people.

With great power comes great responsibility. So, maybe we should go from [governance _by_ algorithms to governance _of_ algorithms](https://oxfordre.com/communication/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228613-e-904). 
But in order to achieve this, perhaps we need to start by changing the democracy algorithm itself.

## More food for thought

- Even in the ”democratic innovations” field, algorithms are being developed and must be questioned to make sure they are ”fair” and transparent (see the Sortition Foundation algorithm and [stratification app](https://github.com/sortitionfoundation/stratification-app), as well as [this article in _Nature_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03788-6))
