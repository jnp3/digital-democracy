Hi there ([Jonathan](https://jonapiron.be) here), welcome to the backstage of this website!


# Publisher

I am responsible for the publication of this website. You can contact me [via e-mail](mailto:jonathan.piron@uclouvain.be).


# Design and production

I designed this website with a particular focus on its simplicity and lightness, in an eco-design and digital sobriety approach. It is a static site generated through [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The simple but effective layout is designed using a CSS framework called [Bulma](https://bulma.io/). 


# Hosting

I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to host this website. The files are deployed to their CDNs from a repo stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/jonapiron/digital-democracy) â€” to be honest, I'd prefer to host everything on [Infomaniak](https://www.infomaniak.com/en/), my favorite registrar [which has values](https://www.infomaniak.com/en/ecology), but [Netlify does a good job as well](https://www.netlify.com/sustainability/) and the combo with GitHub is super convenient.


# Privacy

This site contains no ads, sets no cookies, collects no _analytics_, and just doesn't try to track you.

The fonts on the site are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). That's not a good thing, and I'll fix it as soon as possible... but in the meantime, you know Google: some _trackers_ might be hiding back there. Sorry about that.


# Accessibility

I'm doing my best to make this site accessible to everyone, notably by respecting as much as possible the fundamentals of the [Web Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) from the _World Wide Web Consortium_. However, as this site is partly collaborative, some content may not respect these fundamental principles of accessibility. If you encounter any difficulties while browsing this site or if you have any questions or comments regarding its accessibility, please do not hesitate to [contact me](mailto:jonathan.piron@uclouvain.be).
